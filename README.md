🧠 How I Developed the App
I began by setting up the React environment using [Vite / Create React App].

Created reusable components for better code maintainability.

Applied modular CSS for scoped styling.

Integrated API (if used) to fetch dynamic data using useEffect.

Followed clean code practices, separating logic and presentation.

Version control was maintained using Git throughout the process.

🐞 Challenges Faced
GitHub Push Issues: Encountered problems pushing a large number of files to GitHub due to branch and file size conflicts. Resolved by creating the main branch and using --force push when necessary.

Component Reusability: Initially wrote repetitive code. Refactored it using props and functional components.

State Management Confusion: Learned to properly use useState and useEffect for dynamic behavior.

Deployment Errors: Faced minor issues while deploying due to path conflicts and node module errors.

Folder Size: Managed large static files with .gitignore and used Git best practices.

✅ Lessons Learned
Hands-on experience with Git version control and remote repository management.

Better understanding of how React manages UI and state.

Importance of component structure and code readability.

Debugging real-world project issues during development and deployment.
